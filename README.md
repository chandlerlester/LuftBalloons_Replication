# Luftballons Replication

This repository re-examines the analysis done in "99 Luftballons: Monetary Policy and the house price boom across the U.S. states" by Del Negro and Otrok 

The original paper examines housing prices in the United States from 2001-2005, and concludes that the increase in housing prices across the United States during that time was a national phenomenon. 

Housing prices and recovery from the 2008 recession have varied greatly from state to state. Therefore it might be reasonable to assume that local bubbles are more impactful than previously OR that regionally factors have become increasingly important since the housing crisis. 

The map below shows changes in the annualized average growth rate of the real OFHEO house price index, when extending this study to 2001-2018.

I focus on theorectical macroeconomics, so this project is a work in progress. Currently, I have:

- [x] Complied the data using APIs in R 
- [x] Adjusted my data for inflation, calculated growth rates, coded regional data
- [ ] Extracted the regional, local, and country-wide factors 
- [ ] Examined my results and their robustness
